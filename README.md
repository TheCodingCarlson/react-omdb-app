# React OMDB Movie Search App

![Search View]()
![Details View]()

I created a few versions of this app during my time at [General Assembly Seattle](https://generalassemb.ly/) and recently decided to create a React version using Babel, Webpack, and some new features of ES2017. It's a simple app that allows users to search the OMDB movie database using keywords in the titles. Each successful query returns 10 results. Users can then click on a result card to see more information on a particular film. Hope you enjoy!
